## This one was extremely tough. Found it very difficult to track the number and age of each rabbit whilst also appending the numbers to a list
## Eventually worked out it was more of a maths problem than anything else, just required the knowledge of how to go back in the list to get rid of the dead rabbits

def fib_m(n,m):
    # track number
    # track age of each
    # Fib table makes an empty list
    fib_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i < 2:
            # When lower than 2 append 1 to the list
            fib_list.append(1)
        elif i < m:
            # if i is smaller than m, add fn-1 and fn-2
            fib_list.append(fib_list[-2] + fib_list[-1])
        elif i == m or i == m+1:
            # if i is equal to m or m+1 fn-1 + fn-1 -1
            fib_list.append((fib_list[-2] + fib_list[-1]) - 1)
        else:
            # otherwise fn-1 + fn-2 - count back m+1 through the table
            fib_list.append((fib_list[-2] + fib_list[-1]) - fib_list[-(m+1)])
    return fib_list
fib_m(6,3)
