# Rosalind_Solutions

My solutions to some of the questions over at http://rosalind.info/problems. I am sure many of these problems can be solved more efficiently; often by existing programs. These solutions are simply a test of my knowledge and skill with bioinformatic programming techniques. I will update these answers as I solve more. All solutions are annotated with reasoning and explanation of my choices. Enjoy!
