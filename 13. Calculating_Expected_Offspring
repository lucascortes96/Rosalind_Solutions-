# Each Genotye has a different likelihood of having a dominant offspring
# Each couple will produce two offspring 

n1 = 17635
n2 = 17613
n3 = 18729
n4 = 18608
n5 = 16833
# You can ignore 6 because it won't produce offspring 
n6 = 16537

p1 = 2
p2 = 2
p3 = 2
p4 = 2 * 0.75
p5 = 2 * 0.5

answer = n1*p1 + n2*p2 + n3*p3 + n4*p4 + n5*p5
